# Surfs_Up

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to understand temperature trends occurring in Oahu, Hawaii before committing to the opening of a surf and ice cream business. Weather temperature in the area will have a major impact on the ability of a surf and ice cream business to generate enough income to operate.
Therefore, weather data from the months of June and December will be analyzed to determine feasibility of opening the surf and ice cream business. 

## Results

The table below show the minimum, maximum and average temperatures in Oahu, Hawaii for the months of June and December.
For this business to be profitable, temperatures in the area must be warm enough year-round to generate enough foot traffic in the store to sell surf/beach merchandise and ice cream. 

## Summary

In the summary table below, we see the average temperatures for the months of June and December are in the low 70’s. Similarly, the average high for both months is also the same, coming in at around the mid 80’s. There are many factors that one must consider when starting a business. Weather alone should not be the determining factor; however, it does provide insight to the type of business that has the potential to be profitable in the area. 

-Avg temperatures both months in low 70s

-Avg high/max temperature for both months around mid 80s

The table below show the amount of precipitation the city of Oahu received during the months of June and December. It is challenging to draw any conclusions about the impact of rainfall on this type of business. As you can see below, the average amounts of precipitation for each month is less than an inch. When considering maximum amounts of rainfall in both June and December we see some significant amounts of rainfall. One might consider gathering additional data on more significant weather activity such as hurricanes and their impact on business in the area.
